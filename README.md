## Alex Bennett's Portfolio Site

This portfolio website was built using Facebook's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Execution

As a fun twist, this portfolio site mirrors both the design and functionality of Slack:  the team-oriented instant messaging application that has become increasingly popular among development teams.

Similar to the real Slack application, this site allows users to update their profile name and image, view various channels, send messages, and receive "responses".  

By using an easy-to-use interface that is also very familiar to many developers, hopefully users will find it intuitive and fun to navigate and interact with.
